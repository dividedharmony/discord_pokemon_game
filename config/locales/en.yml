# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization.
# If you want to use locales other than English, add the necessary
# files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
